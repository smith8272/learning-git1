# Git Basics

* `git init` - creates a new git repository in the current folder
* `git status` - some text goes here but idk what it was supposed to say
* `git add` - hold changes so that they can later be deposited in repository (commit)
* `git commit` - save changed files to repository
* `git diff` - shows you the difference between your files 
* `git log` - show log of changes
* `git reset HEAD <file>` dischard changes to a file
* `git push <remote><branch>` - send changes in local repository to a remote repository branch
* `git pull <remote><branch>` retrieve changes from remote repository into local repository
* `blah blah blah this is new`
